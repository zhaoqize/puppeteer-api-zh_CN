### class: Frame

At every point of time, page exposes its current frame tree via the [page.mainFrame()](#pagemainframe) and [frame.childFrames()](#framechildframes) methods.

[Frame] object's lifecycle is controlled by three events, dispatched on the page object:
- ['frameattached'](#event-frameattached) - fired when the frame gets attached to the page. A Frame can be attached to the page only once.
- ['framenavigated'](#event-framenavigated) - fired when the frame commits navigation to a different URL.
- ['framedetached'](#event-framedetached) - fired when the frame gets detached from the page.  A Frame can be detached from the page only once.

An example of dumping frame tree:

```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html');
  dumpFrameTree(page.mainFrame(), '');
  await browser.close();

  function dumpFrameTree(frame, indent) {
    console.log(indent + frame.url());
    for (let child of frame.childFrames())
      dumpFrameTree(child, indent + '  ');
  }
});
```

#### frame.$(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> Selector to query page for
- returns: <[Promise]<?[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves to ElementHandle pointing to the frame element.

The method queries frame for the selector. If there's no such element within the frame, the method will resolve to `null`.

#### frame.$$(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> Selector to query page for
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[ElementHandle]>>> Promise which resolves to ElementHandles pointing to the frame elements.

The method runs `document.querySelectorAll` within the frame. If no elements match the selector, the return value resolve to `[]`.

#### frame.$$eval(selector, pageFunction[, ...args])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to query frame for
- `pageFunction` <[function]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[Serializable]>> Promise which resolves to the return value of `pageFunction`

This method runs `document.querySelectorAll` within the frame and passes it as the first argument to `pageFunction`.

If `pageFunction` returns a [Promise], then `frame.$$eval` would wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.

Examples:
```js
const divsCounts = await frame.$$eval('div', divs => divs.length);
```

#### frame.$eval(selector, pageFunction[, ...args])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to query frame for
- `pageFunction` <[function]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[Serializable]>> Promise which resolves to the return value of `pageFunction`

This method runs `document.querySelector` within the frame and passes it as the first argument to `pageFunction`. If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

If `pageFunction` returns a [Promise], then `frame.$eval` would wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.

Examples:
```js
const searchValue = await frame.$eval('#search', el => el.value);
const preloadHref = await frame.$eval('link[rel=preload]', el => el.href);
const html = await frame.$eval('.main-container', e => e.outerHTML);
```

#### frame.$x(expression)
- `expression` <[string]> Expression to [evaluate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate).
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[ElementHandle]>>>

The method evaluates the XPath expression.

#### frame.addScriptTag(options)
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `url` <[string]> URL of a script to be added.
  - `path` <[string]> Path to the JavaScript file to be injected into frame. If `path` is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to [current working directory](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd).
  - `content` <[string]> Raw JavaScript content to be injected into frame.
  - `type` <[string]> Script type. Use 'module' in order to load a Javascript ES6 module. See [script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) for more details.
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> which resolves to the added tag when the script's onload fires or when the script content was injected into frame.

Adds a `<script>` tag into the page with the desired url or content.

#### frame.addStyleTag(options)
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `url` <[string]> URL of the `<link>` tag.
  - `path` <[string]> Path to the CSS file to be injected into frame. If `path` is a relative path, then it is resolved relative to [current working directory](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd).
  - `content` <[string]> Raw CSS content to be injected into frame.
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> which resolves to the added tag when the stylesheet's onload fires or when the CSS content was injected into frame.

Adds a `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag into the page with the desired url or a `<style type="text/css">` tag with the content.

#### frame.childFrames()
- returns: <[Array]<[Frame]>>

#### frame.click(selector[, options])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to search for element to click. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be clicked.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `button` <[string]> `left`, `right`, or `middle`, defaults to `left`.
  - `clickCount` <[number]> defaults to 1. See [UIEvent.detail].
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between `mousedown` and `mouseup` in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise which resolves when the element matching `selector` is successfully clicked. The Promise will be rejected if there is no element matching `selector`.

This method fetches an element with `selector`, scrolls it into view if needed, and then uses [page.mouse](#pagemouse) to click in the center of the element.
If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

Bear in mind that if `click()` triggers a navigation event and there's a separate `page.waitForNavigation()` promise to be resolved, you may end up with a race condition that yields unexpected results. The correct pattern for click and wait for navigation is the following:

```javascript
const [response] = await Promise.all([
  page.waitForNavigation(waitOptions),
  frame.click(selector, clickOptions),
]);
```

#### frame.content()
- returns: <[Promise]<[String]>>

Gets the full HTML contents of the frame, including the doctype.

#### frame.evaluate(pageFunction, ...args)
- `pageFunction` <[function]|[string]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[Serializable]>> Promise which resolves to the return value of `pageFunction`

If the function passed to the `frame.evaluate` returns a [Promise], then `frame.evaluate` would wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.

If the function passed to the `frame.evaluate` returns a non-[Serializable] value, then `frame.evaluate` resolves to `undefined`.

```js
const result = await frame.evaluate(() => {
  return Promise.resolve(8 * 7);
});
console.log(result); // prints "56"
```

A string can also be passed in instead of a function.

```js
console.log(await frame.evaluate('1 + 2')); // prints "3"
```

[ElementHandle] instances can be passed as arguments to the `frame.evaluate`:
```js
const bodyHandle = await frame.$('body');
const html = await frame.evaluate(body => body.innerHTML, bodyHandle);
await bodyHandle.dispose();
```

#### frame.evaluateHandle(pageFunction, ...args)
- `pageFunction` <[function]|[string]> Function to be evaluated in the page context
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves to the return value of `pageFunction` as in-page object (JSHandle)

The only difference between `frame.evaluate` and `frame.evaluateHandle` is that `frame.evaluateHandle` returns in-page object (JSHandle).

If the function, passed to the `frame.evaluateHandle`, returns a [Promise], then `frame.evaluateHandle` would wait for the promise to resolve and return its value.

```js
const aWindowHandle = await frame.evaluateHandle(() => Promise.resolve(window));
aWindowHandle; // Handle for the window object.
```

A string can also be passed in instead of a function.

```js
const aHandle = await frame.evaluateHandle('document'); // Handle for the 'document'.
```

[JSHandle] instances can be passed as arguments to the `frame.evaluateHandle`:
```js
const aHandle = await frame.evaluateHandle(() => document.body);
const resultHandle = await frame.evaluateHandle(body => body.innerHTML, aHandle);
console.log(await resultHandle.jsonValue());
await resultHandle.dispose();
```


#### frame.executionContext()
- returns: <[Promise]<[ExecutionContext]>> Execution context associated with this frame.

#### frame.focus(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] of an element to focus. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be focused.
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise which resolves when the element matching `selector` is successfully focused. The promise will be rejected if there is no element matching `selector`.

This method fetches an element with `selector` and focuses it.
If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

#### frame.hover(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to search for element to hover. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be hovered.
- returns: <[Promise]> Promise which resolves when the element matching `selector` is successfully hovered. Promise gets rejected if there's no element matching `selector`.

This method fetches an element with `selector`, scrolls it into view if needed, and then uses [page.mouse](#pagemouse) to hover over the center of the element.
If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

#### frame.isDetached()
- returns: <[boolean]>

Returns `true` if the frame has been detached, or `false` otherwise.

#### frame.name()
- returns: <[string]>

Returns frame's name attribute as specified in the tag.

If the name is empty, returns the id attribute instead.

> **NOTE** This value is calculated once when the frame is created, and will not update if the attribute is changed later.

#### frame.parentFrame()
- returns: <?[Frame]> Returns parent frame, if any. Detached frames and main frames return `null`.

#### frame.select(selector, ...values)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to query frame for
- `...values` <...[string]> Values of options to select. If the `<select>` has the `multiple` attribute, all values are considered, otherwise only the first one is taken into account.
- returns: <[Promise]<[Array]<[string]>>> Returns an array of option values that have been successfully selected.

Triggers a `change` and `input` event once all the provided options have been selected.
If there's no `<select>` element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

```js
frame.select('select#colors', 'blue'); // single selection
frame.select('select#colors', 'red', 'green', 'blue'); // multiple selections
```

#### frame.setContent(html)
- `html` <[string]> HTML markup to assign to the page.
- returns: <[Promise]>

#### frame.tap(selector)
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] to search for element to tap. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be tapped.
- returns: <[Promise]>

This method fetches an element with `selector`, scrolls it into view if needed, and then uses [page.touchscreen](#pagetouchscreen) to tap in the center of the element.
If there's no element matching `selector`, the method throws an error.

#### frame.title()
- returns: <[Promise]<[string]>> Returns page's title.

#### frame.type(selector, text[, options])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] of an element to type into. If there are multiple elements satisfying the selector, the first will be used.
- `text` <[string]> A text to type into a focused element.
- `options` <[Object]>
  - `delay` <[number]> Time to wait between key presses in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
- returns: <[Promise]>

Sends a `keydown`, `keypress`/`input`, and `keyup` event for each character in the text.

To press a special key, like `Control` or `ArrowDown`, use [`keyboard.press`](#keyboardpresskey-options).

```js
frame.type('#mytextarea', 'Hello'); // Types instantly
frame.type('#mytextarea', 'World', {delay: 100}); // Types slower, like a user
```

#### frame.url()
- returns: <[string]>

Returns frame's url.

#### frame.waitFor(selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout[, options[, ...args]])
- `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` <[string]|[number]|[function]> A [selector], predicate or timeout to wait for
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves to a JSHandle of the success value

This method behaves differently with respect to the type of the first parameter:
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `string`, then the first argument is treated as a [selector] or [xpath], depending on whether or not it starts with '//', and the method is a shortcut for
  [frame.waitForSelector](#framewaitforselectorselector-options) or [frame.waitForXPath](#framewaitforxpathxpath-options)
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `function`, then the first argument is treated as a predicate to wait for and the method is a shortcut for [frame.waitForFunction()](#framewaitforfunctionpagefunction-options-args).
- if `selectorOrFunctionOrTimeout` is a `number`, then the first argument is treated as a timeout in milliseconds and the method returns a promise which resolves after the timeout
- otherwise, an exception is thrown

#### frame.waitForFunction(pageFunction[, options[, ...args]])
- `pageFunction` <[function]|[string]> Function to be evaluated in browser context
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `polling` <[string]|[number]> An interval at which the `pageFunction` is executed, defaults to `raf`. If `polling` is a number, then it is treated as an interval in milliseconds at which the function would be executed. If `polling` is a string, then it can be one of the following values:
    - `raf` - to constantly execute `pageFunction` in `requestAnimationFrame` callback. This is the tightest polling mode which is suitable to observe styling changes.
    - `mutation` - to execute `pageFunction` on every DOM mutation.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.
- `...args` <...[Serializable]|[JSHandle]> Arguments to pass to  `pageFunction`
- returns: <[Promise]<[JSHandle]>> Promise which resolves when the `pageFunction` returns a truthy value. It resolves to a JSHandle of the truthy value.

The `waitForFunction` can be used to observe viewport size change:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  const watchDog = page.mainFrame().waitForFunction('window.innerWidth < 100');
  page.setViewport({width: 50, height: 50});
  await watchDog;
  await browser.close();
});
```

#### frame.waitForSelector(selector[, options])
- `selector` <[string]> A [selector] of an element to wait for
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `visible` <[boolean]> wait for element to be present in DOM and to be visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `hidden` <[boolean]> wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden, i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by selector string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `selector` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `selector` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the selector doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page.mainFrame()
    .waitForSelector('img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```

#### frame.waitForXPath(xpath[, options])
- `xpath` <[string]> A [xpath] of an element to wait for
- `options` <[Object]> Optional waiting parameters
  - `visible` <[boolean]> wait for element to be present in DOM and to be visible, i.e. to not have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `hidden` <[boolean]> wait for element to not be found in the DOM or to be hidden, i.e. have `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` CSS properties. Defaults to `false`.
  - `timeout` <[number]> maximum time to wait for in milliseconds. Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds). Pass `0` to disable timeout.
- returns: <[Promise]<[ElementHandle]>> Promise which resolves when element specified by xpath string is added to DOM.

Wait for the `xpath` to appear in page. If at the moment of calling
the method the `xpath` already exists, the method will return
immediately. If the xpath doesn't appear after the `timeout` milliseconds of waiting, the function will throw.

This method works across navigations:
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

puppeteer.launch().then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  let currentURL;
  page.mainFrame()
    .waitForXPath('//img')
    .then(() => console.log('First URL with image: ' + currentURL));
  for (currentURL of ['https://example.com', 'https://google.com', 'https://bbc.com'])
    await page.goto(currentURL);
  await browser.close();
});
```
